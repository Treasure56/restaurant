ðŸ‘ŒCorrected the previously named loginsub: Next time, when implementing a login use a login to verify the provided input to prevent ?Unauthorized ERROR
ðŸ‘Œ Changed some other flies input and configurations like:
    registersub.php
    headertwo.php
    dashboard.php
    login.php
    connection.php

see the difference btw loginsub.php and the file named[This file was the problem.php]

    ALSO changed the encryption type you used. although this isn't a live project but the earlier you learn about security polies in SQL the better.
